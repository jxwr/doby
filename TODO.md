## Soon

* [ ] remove Property in each object - done
* [ ] add golang type register support
* [ ] lexer and node states should be in runtime - half done
* [ ] way to make objects with golang builtin types
* [ ] better int family types supoort
* [ ] better autoboxing doubi type and golang type

## Tasks

* [ ] fix bugs, there must be lots of bugs
* [ ] better and rich string operations
* [ ] golang type and methods of type reference and invocation
* [ ] gen IR instead of eval
* [ ] object model (class-based or object-based?)
* [ ] closure seems to be working fine, but I never really got its precise semantic


## RoadMap

1. Better golang support
2. All syntax and semantic correct
3. Object model
4. IR and VM
5. Maybe a little release version
