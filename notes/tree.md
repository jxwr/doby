### Notes from OpenJDK

```java
/**
 * Root class for abstract syntax tree nodes. It provides definitions
 * for specific tree nodes as subclasses nested inside.
 *
 * <p>Each subclass is highly standardized.  It generally contains
 * only tree fields for the syntactic subcomponents of the node.  Some
 * classes that represent identifier uses or definitions also define a
 * Symbol field that denotes the represented identifier.  Classes for
 * non-local jumps also carry the jump target as a field.  The root
 * class Tree itself defines fields for the tree's type and position.
 * No other fields are kept in a tree node; instead parameters are
 * passed to methods accessing the node.
 *
 * <p>Except for the methods defined by com.sun.source, the only
 * method defined in subclasses is `visit' which applies a given
 * visitor to the tree. The actual tree processing is done by visitor
 * classes in other packages. The abstract class Visitor, as well as
 * an Factory interface for trees, are defined as inner classes in
 * Tree
